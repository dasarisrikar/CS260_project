//----------------------- Brief idea regarding files

app.js->main java script file executing user.js
        (it takes requests from pages and sends responses to the webpages)
        (to execute the file enter node app.js in compiler)
        (web page executes at freq 8080 i.e., site to be looked upon http://localhost:8080/login)

user.js->kind of mediator file to app.js
         (actual file to say what response to be given and what to do to requests)

all ejs files are html pages that web pages formed using form action

untagged files are sample sql queries to be executed in database

all json files are provided in the folder itself to execute the javascript code

output pdf is saved as page1.pdf
